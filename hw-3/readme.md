["Hello World!" Sketch](https://madisonflaget.github.io/120-work/hw-3/)

1) I liked getting back into coding. I haven't played with any code since last December so I was surprised how quickly it came back to me. It was also  interesting to learn this new language. I also had the fun of trying to set up the same dev environment on my new laptop. I learned my lesson from last year though. Use short yet descriptive dir names. It makes things so much easier.

2) I had some fun playing around with the p5 sketches embedded in the browser. It was nice to see that instant change occuring. I would love it if you code see the code side by side with the sketch so you could see it updating live (or like every 5 seconds). I disliked having the mover between the tabs.

It was tempting to copy and paste the code from the site, but it was very helpful not to. I learned a lot of random syntax errors that would derail my code. That was a good exercise because I got step by step instructions but also had to learn these lessons.

3) I had a issue that puzzled me for a bit. When I was writing the draw function in my sketch file, I somehow changed the setup function to a draw function. I know this because it was displaying just fine before I started the draw function. I'm sure that I just hit a wrong hotkey somehere. I didn't need to post about it because I ended up finding my error myself.

4) I saw the moving shaping shape at the top of the ["p5.js site"](https://p5js.org/) and really want to learn to make stuff like that. It intrigued me. I'm sure that's too advanced right now but I am looking forward to it

5) Benji0130 was the last issue posted so I tried to answer ["his question"](https://github.com/Montana-Media-Arts/120_CreativeCoding_Fall2017/issues/35). He was super vague and therefore hard to help. I did think I made a good simile to explain pushing to Github.
