[Algorithmic Sketch - Rainy Drive in the Forest](https://madisonflaget.github.io/120-work/hw-6/

1) Summarize the work you did this homework cycle. Paying particular attention to the individual choices you made.

    This week we learned about using math to affect variables in our script. As per usual, I worked through the website then the started the homework.

2) What steps did you take to complete the assignment?

    I started with the idea of randomly generated rectangles. Random algorithms would determins size, shape, position, and even color. Originally this was a combo of green and blue. Later I added an elipse to act as a white eraser of this drawing. This secong shape allowd me to use more thing we learned this week. I bounded the eraser to a centered square just to show that I could, but realized that the effect looked a bit like snow hitting a windshield. I eventually adjusted the eraser to be blue and the rectangles to be only green. The green is supposed to be the forest color moving and changing as you pass it. The blue is the rain.

3) Did you have any problems or issues? How did you solve these? Did you post about these to the class repo issue tracker? Did you receive any useful feedback from your classmates?

    Yes, but I figured it out in console. I was having issues using width and windowWidth to scale things. I eventually got it where it displays, but it still throws and error for line 7. I never did figure out why.

4) Is there anything in particular you learned that you would like to discuss further?

    When I was looking at cool things to do with the shapes, I stumbled across the matrix funtions. I tried to use them but it was difficult to interpret. They look really intersting, but too confusing for me to feel comfortable using just yet.

5) What issues did you help your fellow classmates out with this past homework cycle?

    I helped Cassidy with some live preview issues. She never responded ot us though. Maybe she got it figured out on her own?
