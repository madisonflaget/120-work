1) I had some fun with this week's assignment. I took alot of the pressure off by having almost no restrictions or requirements. I also appreciated having a less difficult week so I can catch up on other things.

2) I was inspired by Shiffman's moving dots example in his video. I wanted to create something that updated and resembled animations and moving dots was one good way. Originally I had a different idea, but it would have required the loop to display as it was drawing. I will hold onto this [idea](/idea.jpg) though and maybe figure out how to use it in the future.

3) I had some issues troubles figuring out good names for my variables. I accidentally created two x variables and two y variables so they were overwriting eachother. And the console wasn't helpful in figuring that out becasue it wasn't throwing and error. But I got that figured out through trial and error.

4) Shiffman seemed to be implying that this method isn't actually animating the image. He said it was like redrawing the the same page in a flip book instead of flipping the pages. I would like to learn more ways to animate.

5) I looked in the issues log Wed morning and only StuffnThingz had posted so far. Jon already helped him with his problem, but I added a thumbs-up to Jon's answer.
