1) Summarize the work you did this homework cycle. Paying particular attention to the individual choices you made. <br>
    We used what we learned ove the past two weeks about arrays(what they are, how to make one, looping through them) and functions (defining, inputing parameters, making code more readable by reusing code via a function, and function returns) to make something. This was a harder assignment because I had to apply 2 weeks worth of material in one assignment.

2) What steps did you take to complete the assignment? <br>
    As usual, I worked through the tutorials on the website. I reviewed Week 9 material as a refresher before I started the assignment (since it had been a week since I read about it). I also pulled multiple tabs of the course website on a seperate screen. I had a tab for each week of content, as well as tabs for the homework decription and p5.js reference page. This helped a lot by allowing me to quckly reference sources and look at my code.

3) Did you have any problems or issues? How did you solve these? Did you post about these to the class repo issue tracker? Did you receive any useful feedback from your classmates? <br>
    I struggled for a while trying to both use my functions and loop through the array. I eventually decided to give up on using the looped array and use a simpler array and some custom functions instead. As I was cleaning up the code, I decided to give it one last shot at it. This time it worked with no issues! :)

4) Is there anything in particular you learned that you would like to discuss further? <br>
    I feel like I am not fully understand how function "return result" can be all that useful. It seems like the function already returns a single value.

5) What issues did you help your fellow classmates out with this past homework cycle? <br>
    At the time of me writing this readme, all issues have been addressed.
