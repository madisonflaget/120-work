1) This week we learned how to draw in p5.js using the draw function. This lesson included instructions on how to use shape, color, rotation, translation,and push/pop functions. We also learned how the order of operations can drastically affect how code is executed. Speaking of which, it we learned how to debug various errors via the JavaScript Console in browser. This was very helpful for me in my coding. Debugging is hard enough, so knowing the line of the error as well as a general idea of what is throwing the error is tremendously helpful.

2) I first went through the site material and related content. I think that the combination of the text walkthrough and video walkthrough was very useful for me. The text allowed me to work at my own pace, glossing over things I already grasped. When I felt a little lost about a particular function, I could watch the parts of the video that apply to idea I was struggling with. I would love to see the hyperlinks embedded in the webpage that point to the different sections of each video because I sometimes only wanted to watch the portion that applied to my question.

I had a lot of fun playing with the code in browser actually. I was playing with the circle of rotating smiley faces to create a shape similar to an archimedes spiral. I did this by swapping the order of operations for rotation() and translation(). I also had to set the x value to increase with each turn. If I had thought it through, I would have taken a screenshot or saved the code.

As for the homework assignment, my idea was sparked my the note to draw the skull first (before the rest of the face). This led my thoughts down the path of a skeletion form. After that it was just a matter of simplifying shape and defining proportions. He is supposed to look like a chibi skeleton, but turned out less cute than intended.

3) I had an issue seeing the code in the website on one of my computers but not the other. The issue seemed to fix itself as soon and I clicked on the "Live Example" link. NoStroke() gave me some trouble until I realized that it was a capitalization issue. I had an issue where translate was making my stuff disappear off of the page, even though it was wrapped in a push/pop. After much cursing and reviewing the Reference page and course website, I finally realized that the combination of my translate and rotate was placing the object off of the page. One or the other was fine, which is why I didn't figure it out sooner. As soon as I knew this, it was just a matter of tinkering to get things placed properly.

4) I had a lot of fun with the transformation functions. They are much harder to grasp, but do more interesting things. I am excited to learn more of them.

5) I posted my solution to my issue in case anyone else had the same issue. I also attempted to help Levi with a noStroke() issue.
