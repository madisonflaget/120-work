1) This week we learned how to draw in p5.js using the draw function. This lesson included instructions onhow to use shape, color, rotation, translation,and push/pop funtions. We also learned how the order of operations can drastically affect how how code is executed. Speaking of which, it we learned how to debug various errors via the JavaScript Console in browser. This was very helpful for me  in my coding. Debugging is hard enough, so knowing the line of the error as well as agenral idea of what is throwing the error is tremendously helpful.

2) I first went through the site material and related content. I think that the combination of the text walkthrough and video walkthrough was very helpful. The text allowed me to work at my own pace, glossing over things I already grasped. When I felt a little lost about a particular function, I could watch the parts of the video that apply to idea I was struggling with. I would love to see the hyperlinks embedded in the webpage that point to the different sections of each video because I sometimes only wanted to watch the portion that applied to my question. As for the homework assignment, my idea was sparked my the note to draw the skull first (before the rest of the face). This led my thoughts down the path of a skeletion form. After that it was just a matter of defining proportions.

3) I had an issue seeing th code in the website on on of my computers but not the other. The issue seemed to fix itself as soon and I clicked on the "Live Example" link. I posted my solution to my issue in case anyone else had the same issue. I also attempted to help Levi with a noStroke() issue.
