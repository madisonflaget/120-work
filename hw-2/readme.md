## Homework Week 2 ##

### Question 1 ###
This week we learned about and played with text editors, GitHub, markdown. I chose to use Atom and GitHub Desktop for this class. I still have Source Tree installed from MART 340, but I like the feel of GitHub desktop better so I'll start using it instead. I also created a new repository for this class and cloned the Github repositorym (even though it wasn't assigned quite yet).

### Question 2 ###
I read from the website (hosted on GitHUb pages of course), played with my GitHub settings, updated Atom, installed GitHub Desktop, and played with markdown (including this file). I also printed off a cheat sheat for PowerShell and bookmarked the Markdown Cheat Sheet.

### Question 3 ###
