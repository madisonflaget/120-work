## Homework Week 2 ##

### Question 1 ###
This week we learned about and played with:

- text editors
- GitHub
- markdown

I chose to use Atom and GitHub Desktop for this class. I still have Sourcetree installed from MART 340, but I like the feel of GitHub desktop better so I'll start using it instead. I also created a new repository for this class and cloned the Github repository (even though it wasn't assigned quite yet).

### Question 2 ###
I did many things.

1. read from the [website](https://montana-media-arts.github.io/creative-coding-1/modules/week-2/overview/) (hosted on GitHub pages of course)
2. played with my GitHub settings
3. updated Atom and Sourcetree
4. installed GitHub Desktop
5. played with markdown (including this file)
6. printed off a cheat sheat for PowerShell
7. bookmarked the Markdown Cheat Sheet
8. made a test markdown file
9. did this homework

### Question 3 ###
I had some issues controlling Git via Command Line and PowerShell. I know the regular commands for making and folding folders/files, but I keep getting an error for cmdlets starting with "git". This happens when I type `git init` or `git --version` for example. My computer doesn't recognize it as a command. Not a big deal though. I still prefer using a GUI.

### Question 4 ###
I kind of want to move the files in my old porfolio directory to a different place on my computer but I remember that I didn't do it because it would break a bunch of links. I would like to know how to do it in case I **need** to do it later on.

### Question 5 ###
We didn't have any issues this week. The only thing I've seen in issues section so far has been the discussion questions, which I posted about.

Also here is my screen shot of my mardown preview.
