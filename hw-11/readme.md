1) Summarize the work you did this homework cycle. Paying particular attention to the individual choices you made.

    This week we learned about object oriented programming, why it's useful, and how to use classes to achcieve this style of code. I chose to break up the website material over a few days (unlike usual where I study all in one long session). I think that this helped my absorb the material a little better. The material was kind of repetitive, but that also helped me wrap my head around the idea of classes and the particular syntax you use with them.

2) What steps did you take to complete the assignment?

    I had the idea of floating water drops sometime sure the lesson material and quickly sketch edit out on paper. As I learned more about how we can use classes, I wrote notes on the next page about what I wanted to manipulate. I also chose to breka things down into bite sized chunks as I was coding. First, I coded the class and drew a single moving ball, then I gradually added the more complex portions (like the arrays and variable sizes). This really helped with my morale as I coded. I always had a previous iteration that was at least functional and I could fix problems as I went along.

3) Did you have any problems or issues? How did you solve these? Did you post about these to the class repo issue tracker? Did you receive any useful feedback from your classmates?

    I had surprisingly few problems this week. I attribute that to the fact that I broke up the coding into smaller chunks. I graudally added on more elements to challenge myself. It's such a simple idea, but it helped a lot. And coding in the object-oriented style made break the coding apart far easier.

4) Is there anything in particular you learned that you would like to discuss further?

    I was trying to figure out a way to set each of 5 new drops to be a different shade of blue, but couldn't figure out a simple solution that wouldn't over complicate the code. I might play with it as I have time over the break. Or maybe I'll eat leftovers and nap. We shall see.

    This isn't related to this week's material, but I would like to learn how to call the p5.js library for my use. This whole semester we have had the library and index.html files made for us. I would like to learn how to set that up and how to call other libraries. Notably, I found several on the p5.js website and was interested to try them, particularly p5.scribble.

5) What issues did you help your fellow classmates out with this past homework cycle?

    None yet, I will stay posted over the break.
