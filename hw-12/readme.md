1) Summarize the work you did this homework cycle. Paying particular attention to the individual choices you made.

    This week I worked through the content and though about how I could implement that in my week 11 coe. I decided to combine several of the techniques for interactivity to make my previous code more intresting

2) What steps did you take to complete the assignment?

    I slowly added more and more interactive elements to my former code. I added stroke colors and made the drops circular. This was to make the drop mroe defined and accomodate a mousePressed function later. Then I made them bounce off of one another, set them to appear from seperate pipes, and set up a timer to trigger them. Clicking on a large drop makes it explode into 3 smaller drops.

3) Did you have any problems or issues? How did you solve these? Did you post about these to the class repo issue tracker? Did you receive any useful feedback from your classmates?

    I was going to have it setup so that if the drop collided, they also split into smaller drops. However, it kept breaking my code. I also realized that ti would cause a problem because droplets colliding would create an infinite number of droplets. This was fixable, but I figured that it wouldn't add much to the piece.

4) Is there anything in particular you learned that you would like to discuss further?

    I kind of want to troubleshoot it more to solve the issue where the drops get stuck on one another.

5) What issues did you help your fellow classmates out with this past homework cycle?

    Commented on SuffnThinz's issue.
